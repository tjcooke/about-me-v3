        <p>Hey, I'm Tyler! I currently live  here in Atlanta with my amazing fiance, Liz, and our two cats, Teddy and Fred. I started developing a passion for technology from a young age and most of my design skills and knowledge are self-taught. I have moved into digital media after joining the Immersive Program at DigitalCrafts where I am learning a range of skills and software including HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, JSON,  A.W.S., and much more. 

          <p>  When I'm not working, you can usually find me learning about tech-related hobbies like the DIY drone community and electronic longboarding. Otherwise, I'm probably at home setting up retro console emulation and inviting friends over for classic gaming and drinks. I've always loved anything technology related and coming up with clever, interesting ways to utilize my devices in ways they were never intended to be used. </p>
